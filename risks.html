<p>Hacking is breaking into code and either discovering or bypassing passwords, by illegal means, to gain unauthorized entry to a computer system. It can disrupt e-commerce because these sites involve payments and if someone gains unauthorized access they may steal lots of sensitive details, including payment details such as credit card information and PIN codes and leading to fraud and a complete loss of trust in the site. It can be countered using strong passwords, employing a security team to maintain and protect your company would be a good idea for high level targets. This team of IT security experts will analyse the potential threats and likely openings so that alterations can be made to the systems which attempt to close them.</p>

<p>Malware is malicious software; this software is made to damage and gain access to a system. Malware can be in many different forms, spyware which tracks what the user is doing, keyloggers work by tracking what the user types, viruses and worms. And if your systems are infected by malware it can affect your business because the malware can destroy the machines to cause a loss of financial data, and can be used to encrypt the valuable and critical data on company machines to extort money. However if your website is infected by malware it can affect your clients/users because it can be used to steal your clients payment information. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The countermeasures to Malware include rolling back to an older version of the website they help recovery of the website.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another countermeasure would be whitelists and black lists, malicious sites could be blacklisted as to not be able to effect the website. This prevents malware being able to access the website.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Appropriate virus protection should be used and updated regularly, this can be used to block out malware. This prevents malware being able to gain access to the system.</p>

<p>Someone hijacking your website is a threat because they can may use this to gain access to secure information within your websites, this could be very dangerous if the website has online transactions you can help to prevent this by making sure you are employ people to look after this site security wise and always making sure there are no vulnerabilities in the website.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Website defacement is the process where your website can be defaced with anything, including political and social messages and you can counter it using automated scanning to test if there are any vulnerabilities and fix these vulnerabilities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Not using encryption (SSL, HTTPS, RSA certificates) for secure transactions is bad because modern networked applications need to communicate confidential information back and forwards. SSL is the mechanism which encrypts the communications between any client and server computer over a network. This can be email servers and email clients or websites and browsers. HTTPS is where websites communication HTTP securely encrypted over SSL. The encryption is proved by Public Key Certificates by using the RSA algorithm. Without using theses techniques the data sent between browsers and web servers is sent in plain text, without being encrypted. Meaning that anyone can eavesdrop you, or perform “Man-in-the-Middle” attacks, intercepting and grabbing confidential information like passwords, pin numbers, financial details.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Not enforcing strong passwords for clients is a problem because it increases the chances that the passwords could be cracked, for instance by brute force dictionary attacks or commonly used passwords anyone who gains access to an account by stealing the password can perform all the operation and access all the data that account has privileges to. with access to the systems may be able to gain access to the system. This can cause a risk of confidentially as unauthorized users can see any data.</p>
