	<h3> Inclusion </h3>
	<p> There are many problems you can have whilst creating a website in regards to the text. <br> <br>
	One problem could be that the text is too small to read for people with visual impairments, this means the text has to be at a size which is easy for people to read.
	Of course the size can not be too big otherwise it would look to unprofessional, so the website has to use a size which makes it easy for every to read.
	I choose the size 16 pixels for my font - this makes it easy to read <br> <br>
	Another problem that people could have with font is the fact that the font type may not be easily readable for dysleix people, they may strugle with font styles such as comic sans
	this is why the website is made with the font style that is easy for every one to read throughout.<br> <br>
	Headings are used throughout my page and this is beacause I want the user to be able to quickly reach there desired information quickly.
	Everything on the webpage is only a couple of clicks away. Navigation bars are also used throughout the site to help
	users around the website </p>
