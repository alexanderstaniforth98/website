		<h3>Mood-boards and storyboards</h3>
		<p>
		They are a step by step detailed illustration  of how you will go about actually making the site, you decide how it will look, how it will function and where all the 
		links will link to - how people navigate around your site. <br>
		These are made because it is important to design your website before actually making it. This allows you to actually think about what you are going
		to add. This also means that your clients will understand what their website will be made like, and to see if they want you to include/ not include anything
		so you don't waste your time actually making your website. This also provides guidance for the developers of the site<br>
		The steps in which they are used is:<br></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Initial outline to the client</li>
			<li> Website design documentation</li>
			<li> Website creation</li>
		</ul>
		
	
		<h3> Pseudo code for scripts </h3>
		<p>
		Pseudo code is code that informs the devs what is required from the scripts running as part of the site, it is step by step code that is not written fully<br>
		This is the outline of the scripted code for the site that can be provided to designers; it should ensure the creators produce 
		the desired coded actions. It does not tell them the code but rather what code they should write<br>
		The steps in which they are used is:<br></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Initial outline to the client</li>
			<li> Website design documentation</li>
			<li> Website creation</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
		



		<div id="Area_12">
	<h3>Style guides</h3>
	<p>They are colour guides and 960/1000 grid<br>
	The design document should include which grid system you shall be using and colour guides for Hexadecimal and RGB colors<br>
	These are important because it allows the client to know what their website will look like, and tells the devs what is required.
	These stages are:<br></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Initial outline to the client</li>
			<li> Website design documentation</li>
			<li> Website creation</li>
		</ul>
		
	
	<h3>Creation tools for HTML, CSS and javascript.</h3>
	<p>
	These tools are used to create the website. Such tools for example could be notepad ++ and online tools such as HTML edity, css edity and Javascript Edity<br><br>
	They are important to the designers as they allow the designers to easily create the website, the better the tools the easier the website will be to create

	<h3>Navigation diagram creators</h3>
	<p> Navigation diagrams are used to show how a site's pages link together throughout the website. 
	It is essential to create good navigation diagrams because it allows users to move around the website easily, and we want
	to make sure the website is as easy as possible to use, the stages these are used are:<br></p>
		<ul>
			<li> Initial outline to the client </li>
			<li> Website design documentation</li>
			<li> Website creation</li>
		</ul>
	
<h3> Outlining HTML tags </h3>
	<p>	There are several HTML tags in the design that control the styles and positioning of elements. For example:
			<ul>
				<li>Div</li>
				<li>Span</li>
				<li>Table</li>
				<li>iframe</li>
			</ul>
		The div tag is used as a way of grouping tags and sections of a webpage. The DIV tag allows formating to be used in certain areas of code.
		Divs don't do anything by themselves, you have to style them. You can style them by assigning a class and styling the class in the css, with use
		of either the hashtag or full stop before the class name in the css. Remember to close the Div tag when you are done with it otherwise it could cause
		problems with other things in the page.<br> <br>
		The Span is used in the middle of the text to change the text halfway through a sentence so it is different that the other text.<br> <br>
		Tables can be used to show information in a tabled format. tbody is used for the table's body, th for table heading, tr for table's row creator, td the tables column creator,
		caption adds a caption for the table.<br> <br>
		Frames can be used to add things such as calendars and videos, there use is to create a frame inside your web page in order to allow embedding of an active object.
		</p>
		</div>
		
		<div id="Area_14">
		<h3>Css</h3>
		<p> CSS is the style of the webpage and improves the way everything looks, there can be css pages made which all pages may reference and use, multiple styles may be used over and over again.
		CSS improvements the way everything looks. CSS is important to creating a easy to use, good looking website.<br>
		CSS may be used in the:
		<ul>
			<li> Website design documentation</li>
			<li> Website creation</li>
			<li> Modifications after client review </li>
			<li> Maintenance of the site </li>
		</ul>
		</p><br> <br>
		<h3> Javascript </h3>
		<p> javascript can be used on the site to improve functionality; I use javascript to add a clock to my site. <br>
		It is important to add Javascript because there is only so much web devs can do with HTML and CSS so Javascript is used to add real time functionality<br>
		Javascript may be used in:
		<ul>
			<li> Website design documentation</li>
			<li> Website creation</li>
			<li> Modifications after client review </li>
			<li> Maintenance of the site </li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h3> Meta </h3>
		<p>Meta tags explain the website's content and are used so search engines can find your website easily as they know what the web page is about. Meta tags do not appear on the website, only in the code.
