	<h3>What is it?</h3>
	<p> It is the approach to the design and planning of websites.
	Technology used for the web server and allowing the user to view it. 
	Internet service providers are needed by the user, it is the interface between the Internet and the users. Simply put, it is a company that provides you with internet access.<br> <br>
	There are two different ISP types: Subscription and unmetered. The costs for each type changes depending on requirements and location.
	ISP will determine the connection method, the connection method is based on location.
	Connection methods are (but not limited to): cable modems, ADSL, SDSL and leased lines.
	Web hosting is needed as you need a server to create websites. Depending on the host depends on the services. Some websites will be on the cloud, others on a shared area and some that are on a dedicated server.
	HTML is most commonly used, however it can be any file. It sends the content to the user by using the HTTP protocol, it must use this protocol in order to be a web server.

	<h3>Domain Structure and Registrars</h3>
	<p> The domain is the website name, for example:www.google.com.
	Domains contain web pages, non-web based e-mail and file transfer services. The webservices for hardtime accedemy would be www.hardtimes.ac.uk, for email it would be either
	pop3.hardtimes.ac.uk and smtp.hardtimes.ac.uk. For file transfer it would be ftp.lincolncollge.ac.uk.

<br> <br>
	A domain naming registrar is a company that manages the reservation of Internet domain names. They will sell to users any domain that are available, some domains will cost more than others.
	In the domain structure of www.hardtimes.ac.uk the www is a third level domain, the hardtimes is a second level domain and the .com is a top level domain.
<br> <br>
	The internet is simply a system of world wide interconnected computer network. 
	The world wide web (www) is a series of websites that can be viewed by a internet browser. 
	The world wide web is the information which users can see.
	HTML is the standard file on a web site, it stands for Hypertext Markup Language. 
	It is used for tagging text files to achieve font and colour.
	HTTP is the protocol that web servers must follow. It stands for Hypertext Transfer protocol and without it the devices on the WWW would not be able to communicate together.
	URL stands for Uniform Resource Identifier and is the address of all resource on the internet.

	<h3>Web componetents</h3>
	<p>

The server is a device that provides clients with data; this can be in many forms, for example: html, files, e-mail, or one of many of services that are readily available right now.
<br> <br>
A server has a specialised server OS (operating system) it is written to maximise the hardware for its chosen specialism. There are many services the server can chose; in this unit its services are: web, mail, proxy services.
<br> <br>
Typically, servers have multiple CPUs. The CPUs have an in chip AES encryption, this is important as the server may need to store secure data; encryption and security is a must for a lot of people. RAM is used to store all the connections to it. Multiple gigabytes of data are stored on multiple hard-drives, they also have fault recovery systems. These CPUs are fail safe as they have multiple power supplies, this is so if one fails there are others to prevent system failure.
<br> <br>
Normally, servers don’t have high spec graphics. Also, servers have limited browser access. This prevents the servers to be misused, this lowers the risk of errors, and decreases the risk the malware. Servers are designed to server not make requests.
<br> <br>
Web Servers
are used to store a website and to provide the client with access to this website.
Web server software such as: Apache and Microsoft Internet Information Service.
Layer 7 is used to receive http requests and layer 5 is used as a Web server software for processing
The two TCP port numbers are port 80 for http, port 443 for https.


A mail server is a secure service to send and receive mail.
There are many server applications: Microsoft Exchange server, ArGoSoft Mail Server, hMailServer.
The two TCP port numbers are 25 - SMTP, 110 - POP3
Proxy Servers; It hides private IP addresses by giving the proxy a new IP address that will be used to communicate on the internet. It may prevent hackers from gaining access to your site by blocking malicious traffic and sites It can use Whitelist and blacklist, when a IP is blacklisted the client will not be able to communicate with it, blacklisted IPs could be malicious websites. White listed means it is a good IP and communication can take place.
It can log activity, for example what websites a client visits and for how long.
<br> <br>
To improve performance as a website can be loaded from a cache it will be quicker than using DNS lookup
<br> <br>
A router is a device that is made to transport (also known as routing) data requests between networks. A client on one network will need a router to access a service that is not in one's network. They are important for server services as the large majority of the time the services will be outside the client's network.
<br> <br>
There are different types of routers, all with the same function - route data packets from the client’s network to the server network back and forth.
<br> <br>
The speed of the router affects the web servers client, the faster the router the faster the web server can load its pages, slower routers mean slower performance.
<br> <br>
The router acts a programmable firewall and security device for business, this is important to a web server’s delivery as it may block out any malicious devices and users.
<br> <br>
Software browsers are needed to show websites that have been made with CSS, Javascript, server scripting scripting. The client needs to decide the best browser for them, there are many different options available for users today; The three most popular being: Google Chrome, Firefox and unfortunately Internet Explorer.
<br> <br>
Browser extensions are things the client can add to their browser, these can affect many things on the browser. The most popular extension is adblock which is great for the user as it blocks them from viewing ads on websites, this is not so great for the website especially if you rely on ads to pay for your server or even your wage. There are many browsers extensions that can hinder your website from a technical standpoint, for example there is a browser addon called NoScrpit which blocks javascript, this is to make sure the client can surf the internet more secure with better privacy however if the website relies on javascript to function correctly, it could mean the website will not work at all.
<br> <br>
The HTML5 benchmark tests how well you website can cope with HTML5 this should affect your website design as HTML5 really is the way forward for websites and you need to make sure your website can support it.
<br> <br>
Email Clients
Email clients are an important part within website conversation, between the client and the creator. The clients may use email in different ways, depending on what you expect from them this affects the functionality of the e-mail service or services they use.
<br> <br>
There are many E-Mail clients that are available for users. Email clients are more customizable. You have to download it so it takes up space on your Hard Drive, also there may be some places for example work and school where you can’t download the client therefore not being able to use the email client.
<br> <br>
A protocol is a rule which computers must follow. There are hundreds of network protocols. This is so networks can effectively communicate.

<div id="Area_16">

<h3>Protocols</h3>
<p>
IP These protocols are unique numbers which are addresses given to devices when connected to the internet. For devices such as a website we use DNS. This translates domain names into IP addresses. This means that the DNS server translates the name into a IP address, for example www.hardtimes.ac.uk could be 198.105.102.2. This is because in the internet communication is based on IP addresses. The protocol it uses is port 53 on the TCP and UDP. The domain naming service uses 4 dedicated types of servers to connect with the URL.

<br><br>

The reason why we use www.hardtimes.ac.uk as the name is beaucse it would be hard for humans to remeber all the IP addressers. At the end of the URL there is a dot that the user never types, this represents the root of the namespace. When you search a website your browser and operating system will determine if they know what the IP address is already; the website could already be stored in the computer or the cache. If the computer does not know where the website is the operating system is configured to ask a resolving name server for IP addresses it does not know, the resolving name server is within the OS which is either configured manually or automatically. If the resolving name server does not know then it asks the root name server, then the com nameservers will be queried, the COM nameservers are called the top level domain name server. 

<br> <br> 
Now the .com. has been found all that needs to be found is the name before it for example “hardtimes” these are authoritative name server. The authoritative name server tells the resolving name server the IP address of the website, the resolving name server tells the operating system the IP address of the website which tells the browser which stores it in the cache. 

<br> <br>

The domain registrar is told which authoritative name servers the domain should use when the domain is purchased. Application layer protocol These are protocols that are used to connect you to a correct IP address. These are provided by the server. Examples would be http for webpages and ftp for fle transfer servers, of course there is many more. 

<br> <br> 

TCP Application layer protocols need to be identified as numbers because networks are number systems. TCP changes the application layer protocols to numbers for example http is 80. TCP/IP TCP/IP is used because when you send data it contains your IP address and then the TCP number is used to identify the application.
