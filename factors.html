		<h3>User side factors that influence website performance:</h3>
		<p>Download speeds are one of the factors of User side factors. Download speeds are the result of the area that the user is connecting from and the ISP the user is connecting from. The better the ISP the faster the download speed.
 Another factor is the Area, for example rural areas will not be able to get as fast a download speed as those living in a city.
 Depending on the country the user lives in depends on how fast the download speed will be as well. Sweden will have better download speeds than Ethiopia for example. If a website is full of images then it will take longer to download than one that is not, so try to restrict media for best possible speeds.
You need to think about the target audience and how fast their download speeds will be when creating your website for the best possible performance.
<br> <br>
The second factor is PC performance, depending on the user's computer the rate at which the computer can show the webpages is affected. Three factors that affect this are Browser Used, Cache memory, processor speed.

		<h3>Server side factors that influence website performance:</h3>
		<p>Server side factors are the factors that affect the performance of the website from the server end, there is nothing the client can do about these factors.

Firstly a web server is what the website is hosted on and what the client connects to when the go to a website.
you can choose the capacity of the webserver, if you aren't expecting more than a couple hundred views per day you won't need to spend a lot of money on server capacity
however companies like google which has millions of regular users will have to own a lot of servers. If more people try to access the website than the server can handle
the website will be forced offline. File types and the content we use can affect the performance. Try to use less media content and smaller files for improved performance.
Files uploaded to the website will affect the website in different ways, highly compressed files will be lower quality this will improve bandwidth but the photo may not look to good if compressed to much.
There are different file types like GIFs, gifs take up more bandwidth than normal Jpeg files and take longer to load.</p>
